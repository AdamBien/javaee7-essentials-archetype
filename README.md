Consider switching to [Java EE 8 Essentials Archetype](https://github.com/AdamBien/javaee8-essentials-archetype)

A Plain and Clean JavaEE 7 Maven Archetype
=====================

This artifact is installed in the maven central repository and can be automatically installed using the
mvn archetype:generate invocation:

`mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=com.airhacks:javaee7-essentials-archetype`

Choose the version v1.3 if you like to have beans.xml and JAXRSConfiguration included and v1.2 for a plain Java EE project.
